## Please~~!!

### Add support for text, line, rectangle.

### With all those previous bugs solved for ellipse, it should be easy.



## Property

- Author: xudenden
- Starting date: 28-4-2019
- Dependency: E.Roberts pc-borland graphics library(qianhui modified)(augmentation inside the library is done)



## Funtion

1. Draw a line, rectangle, ellipse on the screen.
2. Move them like in PS.
3. Toggle them like in PS.
4. Text frame(to be implemented)



## Update

1. Now you can draw a ellipse(or many ellipse) like in any other graphic processing software.
2. Movement also supported for ellipse.
3. Toggling is supported as well.
4. How to try those features?
   - Hit the `f3` key on your keyboard to tell the program that you selected the `ellipse` tool from the toolbox.
   - Press `left button` on your mouse within the graphic window area.
   - Move your mouse with `left button` down. Now you can see an ellipse appearing on your screen.
   - Release `left button`, the ellipse stays on your screen.
   - Hit `f5` to select the `hand` tool.
   - You can `left click` on an ellipse you've drawn to select it.(A `toggle box` should appear.)
   - Or `move` it around within the window. (A `toggle box` should appear.)
   - With your `toggle box ` on the screen, toggle the ellipse selected on the screen.
   - Want to close the window? Hit `Alt + f4`.



## My Thoughts

You think it works smoothly, don't you?

Hhhhh.

The actual source **IS COMPLETELY A MESS**.

### A MESS!!

Nothing more to say.

Feeling dead already.
