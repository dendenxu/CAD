## My Thoughts

You think it works smoothly, don't you?

Hhhhh.

The actual source **IS COMPLETELY A MESS**.

### A MESS!!

Nothing more to say.

Feeling dead already.

### Well...

After two hours, the logic is becoming clearer.

I've noticed that you should never just change things. You should have a plan.

Coding a project is like building a kingdom. hhhh.
