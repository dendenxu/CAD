## 操作手册

- To draw, move or toggle an ellipse
  - Hit the `f3` key on your keyboard to tell the program that you selected the `ellipse` tool from the toolbox.
  - Press `left button` on your mouse within the graphic window area.
  - Move your mouse with `left button` down. Now you can see an ellipse appearing on your screen.
  - Release `left button`, the ellipse stays on your screen.
  - Hit `f5` to select the `hand` tool.
  - You can `left click` on an ellipse you've drawn to select it.(A `toggle box` should appear.)
  - Or `move` it around within the window. (A `toggle box` should appear.)
  - With your `toggle box ` on the screen, toggle the ellipse selected on the screen.
  - Want to close the window? Hit `Alt + f4`.
- To draw or move a text frame along with its text, just hit the `f4` key and do whatever you want as if it were an ellipse. I'll list what to do.
  - Hit the `f4` key on your keyboard to tell the program that you selected the `textframe` tool from the toolbox.
  - Press `left button` on your mouse within the graphic window area.
  - Move your mouse with `left button` down. Now you can see an line appearing on your screen.
  - Release `left button`, the line stays on your screen.
  - Then you're supposed to see twinkling cursor at the up-left corner of the `textframe`.
  - Now type what you want to see on the screen inside the `textframe`. Note that `Backspace`, `Delete`, `Left`, `Right`, `Enter` keys are supported while editing your text.
  - The text-frame supports line buffer, which means once you've hit the `enter` key, the text of the previous line cannot be selected from now on.(Unless you're already at the bottom of the text frame, where `enter` don't submit the line being edited.)
  - Please avoid Chinese word. If you enter Chinese, scrambled code may appear, or `Song-Ti` Character may appear but cursor behaves badly. In all, don't try.
  - **REMEMBER TO HIT `ESC` WHEN YOU'RE DONE WITH THIS TEXT-FRAME**. Or... bad things may happen. Or maybe nothing happens.
  - Hit `f5` to select the `hand` tool.
  - You can `left click` on the frame of the text you've typed to select it.(A `toggle box` should appear. Bigger than that of a rectangle or ellipse or line.)
